# Feature: Resume Purpose and Target Industry Fields

## Summary
Added `purpose` and `target_industry` fields to the Resume model to allow users to specify the purpose and target industry for each resume. This helps users organize and tailor their resumes for different job applications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `backend/pb_migrations/1728667000_add_resume_purpose_industry.js`
- Added migration to add two new fields to the `resumes` collection:
  - `purpose` (text, max 200 chars) - e.g., "Frontend Developer - Tech Startup"
  - `target_industry` (text, max 100 chars) - e.g., "Technology", "Healthcare", "Finance"
- Migration includes rollback functionality

### 2. TypeScript Type Updates
- **File**: `app/src/lib/types/index.ts`
  - Updated `Resume` interface to include `purpose?` and `target_industry?` fields
  
- **File**: `app/src/lib/types/resume.ts`
  - Updated `Resume` interface to include `purpose?` and `target_industry?` fields
  - Updated `ResumeBuilderData` interface to include these fields

### 3. Resume Builder Store Updates
- **File**: `app/src/lib/stores/resumeBuilder.ts`
  - Added `purpose` and `target_industry` to `defaultBuilderData`
  - Created `updatePurpose()` and `updateTargetIndustry()` functions
  - Updated `saveResume()` to persist these fields to PocketBase
  - Updated `loadResumeForEditing()` to load these fields when editing existing resumes

### 4. Resume Store Updates
- **File**: `app/src/lib/stores/resume.ts`
  - Updated `create()` function to include `purpose` and `target_industry` fields
  - Default `target_industry` from user profile if available

### 5. UI Components

#### Personal Info Tab (Builder)
- **File**: `app/src/lib/components/builder/PersonalInfoTab.svelte`
- Added new section "Resume Purpose & Target" with:
  - Purpose input field with icon and placeholder
  - Target Industry input field with icon and placeholder
  - Helper text explaining each field
  - Reactive state management with `$effect` for syncing with store

#### Dashboard Resume Cards
- **File**: `app/src/routes/dashboard/+page.svelte`
- Updated resume card display to show:
  - Purpose with Briefcase icon
  - Target Industry with Target icon
- Added icon imports (Briefcase, Target)

#### Builder Preview Tab
- **File**: `app/src/routes/builder/+page.svelte`
- Added "Resume Metadata" section in preview tab showing:
  - Purpose and Target Industry in a styled card
  - Only displays if at least one field is filled
  - Uses blue theme to match other info sections

## User Experience

### Creating a Resume
1. User navigates to `/builder`
2. In the "Personal Info" tab, they see a new section "Resume Purpose & Target"
3. User can optionally fill in:
   - **Purpose**: Specific role or purpose (e.g., "Senior React Developer - Fintech")
   - **Target Industry**: Industry they're targeting (e.g., "Financial Technology")
4. These fields are saved with the resume

### Viewing Resumes
1. **Dashboard**: Resume cards display purpose and target industry below the title
2. **Builder Preview**: Metadata section shows these fields before the resume preview
3. **Organization**: Users can quickly identify which resume is for which purpose/industry

## Benefits

1. **Organization**: Users can easily distinguish between multiple resumes
2. **Context**: Clear indication of what each resume is tailored for
3. **Tracking**: Better ability to track which resumes are used for which applications
4. **Future Features**: Foundation for:
   - Filtering resumes by industry
   - Industry-specific recommendations
   - Analytics by purpose/industry
   - Automated tagging and categorization

## Technical Notes

### Migration
- Migration file follows PocketBase naming convention: `timestamp_description.js`
- Includes both up and down migrations for safe rollback
- Fields are optional (not required) to maintain backward compatibility

### Type Safety
- All TypeScript interfaces updated to include new fields
- Fields are optional (`?`) to support existing resumes
- Proper type checking throughout the codebase

### State Management
- Reactive state management using Svelte 5 `$effect` runes
- Proper synchronization between local component state and global store
- Unsaved changes tracking includes these fields

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing resumes without these fields will continue to work
- Fields are optional in all interfaces
- UI gracefully handles missing values

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Create new resume with purpose and target_industry
- [x] Edit existing resume to add these fields
- [x] View resume cards on dashboard showing new fields
- [x] View preview tab showing metadata section
- [x] Verify fields persist after save
- [x] Verify fields load correctly when editing
- [x] Test with empty/missing fields (graceful handling)

### Type Checking
- No new TypeScript errors introduced
- All existing type checks pass
- Proper type inference throughout

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dropdown Suggestions**: Pre-populated industry options
2. **Auto-tagging**: Automatically tag resumes based on purpose/industry
3. **Filtering**: Filter dashboard resumes by industry
4. **Analytics**: Track success rates by industry/purpose
5. **Templates**: Industry-specific template recommendations
6. **AI Integration**: Suggest purpose/industry based on resume content

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/pb_migrations/1728667000_add_resume_purpose_industry.js` (new)

### Types
- `app/src/lib/types/index.ts`
- `app/src/lib/types/resume.ts`

### Stores
- `app/src/lib/stores/resumeBuilder.ts`
- `app/src/lib/stores/resume.ts`

### Components
- `app/src/lib/components/builder/PersonalInfoTab.svelte`

### Routes
- `app/src/routes/dashboard/+page.svelte`
- `app/src/routes/builder/+page.svelte`

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: The migration will run automatically when PocketBase starts
2. **No Breaking Changes**: All changes are backward compatible
3. **No Data Migration Needed**: Existing resumes will have null/undefined for new fields
4. **Frontend**: Deploy frontend after backend migration is complete

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ Add purpose field to Resume model
- ✅ Add target_industry field to Resume model
- ✅ Update resume creation to capture these fields
- ✅ Show in resume list/cards
- ✅ Add to resume metadata
- ✅ Update database schema
