## 🚀 Generation Strategy

### Let Auto-Select Work for You

**The Auto strategy is right 95% of the time**

#### When to Use Auto

**Perfect for:**
- ✅ First-time users
- ✅ Standard career paths
- ✅ When unsure which strategy fits
- ✅ Most job applications

**How Auto Works:**
1. Analyzes your years of experience
2. Checks your career stage
3. Evaluates profile completeness
4. Selects optimal strategy automatically

#### When to Override Auto

**Choose Experienced Professional if:**
- You have 3+ years experience
- Auto selected First-Time but you're not
- You want to emphasize achievements
- Applying for senior roles

**Choose First-Time Job Seeker if:**
- You're a student or recent graduate
- Auto selected Experienced but you're entry-level
- You want to emphasize education
- You have limited work experience

**Choose Career Change if:**
- You're switching industries
- You're transitioning to new role
- You want to highlight transferable skills
- Your experience is in different field

**💡 Pro Tip:** Try Auto first. If results don't match your situation, regenerate with manual selection.

If job requires "project management," use "project management" not "managed projects"

#### Use Standard Formatting

**✅ ATS-Friendly:**
- Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Clear section headings
- Bullet points for lists
- Standard date formats (MM/YYYY)

**❌ ATS-Unfriendly:**
