# Builder Integration Complete

## Summary
Successfully integrated the industry/template selection system into the resume builder as the FIRST step.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Builder Flow
**File**: `app/src/routes/builder/+page.svelte`

- **Settings is now Step 1** (renamed to "Get Started")
- Builder starts on settings step instead of personal info
- Tab order updated to prioritize industry/template selection

**New Tab Order**:
1. ✅ **Get Started** (Settings) - Choose industry & design
2. Personal Info
3. Summary
4. Education/Experience
5. Skills
6. Projects
7. Preview

### 2. Redesigned SettingsTab
**File**: `app/src/lib/components/builder/SettingsTab.svelte`

**Before**: Generic template selector with color schemes
**After**: Two-step industry + template selector

**Features**:
- Welcome message explaining the process
- Integrates `IndustryTemplateSelector` component
- Automatically populates resume with seed data
- Shows success message after selection
- Auto-advances to next step
- Disables "Next" button until selection is made

### 3. Data Population Logic

When user selects industry + template:

```typescript
// Takes seed data from industry
summary = industry.summaryTemplates[0]
skills = industry.skillSuggestions (high priority, top 6)
experience = industry.experienceExamples
education = industry.educationExamples

// Takes design from template
settings.template = template.id
settings.colorScheme = template.settings.colorScheme
settings.fontSize = template.settings.fontSize
// ... etc
```

## User Experience

### Step 1: Get Started (Settings)

## Files Modified

   - Updated tab order (settings first)
   - Changed initial step to 'settings'

2. `app/src/lib/components/builder/SettingsTab.svelte`
   - Complete rewrite
   - Integrated IndustryTemplateSelector
   - Added data population logic
   - Added success state

## Files Created (Previously)

1. `app/src/lib/seed-data/` - Industry content
2. `app/src/lib/templates/design-templates.ts` - Visual designs
3. `app/src/lib/components/builder/IndustryTemplateSelector.svelte` - Selection UI

## Conclusion

The builder now provides a guided, industry-specific experience that:
- Starts with the most important decision (what job + how it looks)
- Populates the resume with relevant starter content
- Allows full customization in subsequent steps
- Separates content from design for maximum flexibility

Users get the best of both worlds:
- **Generic templates** (not locked into industry-specific designs)
- **Industry-specific content** (relevant skills, examples, guidance)
