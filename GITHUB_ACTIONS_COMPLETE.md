# 🎉 GitHub Actions Complete Setup

## 📋 Workflows Created

### 1. **Test Setup** (`test-setup.yml`)
- ✅ **Purpose**: Verify everything is configured correctly
- ✅ **Trigger**: Manual only
- ✅ **Checks**: Repository structure, secrets, Railway CLI

### 2. **Manual Deploy** (`manual-deploy.yml`)
- ✅ **Purpose**: Deploy backend to Railway manually
- ✅ **Trigger**: Manual with environment selection
- ✅ **Features**: Health checks, deployment verification

### 3. **Backend Deploy** (`deploy-backend.yml`)
- ✅ **Purpose**: Auto-deploy backend on changes
- ✅ **Trigger**: Push to main (backend files only)
- ✅ **Features**: Smart triggering, health verification

### 4. **Full Stack Deploy** (`deploy-full-stack.yml`)
- ✅ **Purpose**: Deploy both backend and frontend
- ✅ **Trigger**: Push to main or manual
- ✅ **Features**: Sequential deployment, environment passing

## 🚀 Deployment Process
