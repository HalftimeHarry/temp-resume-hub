# Production Test Plan

## ✅ Your Collections Look Great!

Your PocketBase setup is 95% perfect! Just a few minor tweaks needed, but it should work as-is.

## Step 1: Update App Configuration

Make sure your app has this environment variable:
```bash
PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=https://pocketbase-production-1493.up.railway.app
```

## Step 2: Deploy and Test

### Test Registration Flow:
1. **Go to your app** → `/auth/register`
2. **Create a new account**
3. **Should redirect to** → `/onboarding`
4. **Complete the profile setup**
5. **Check PocketBase admin** for the new profile record

### Test Profile Management:
1. **Go to** → `/profile`
2. **Edit profile information**
3. **Save changes**
4. **Verify updates** in PocketBase admin

### Test Recommendations:
1. **Go to** → `/test/profile-recommendations`
2. **Should show your actual profile data**
3. **Generate recommendations**
4. **Verify personalized suggestions**

## Step 3: Minor Fixes (Optional)

If you want to make the small improvements:

### Fix user field:
- Edit the `user` field in user_profiles
- Set `required: true`
- Set `cascadeDelete: true`

### Fix name fields:
- Edit `first_name` and `last_name`
- Set `required: false`

### Update experience_level:
- Add `"career_change"` to the values list

### Update preferred_work_type:
- Change `maxSelect` from 2 to 3

## Step 4: Monitor and Debug

### Check Application Logs:
Look for these success messages:
```
✅ User profile created: [profile_id]
✅ Profile saved successfully: [profile_id]
✅ Generated X recommendations
```

### Check PocketBase Admin:
- Go to Records → user_profiles
- Verify new profiles are being created
- Check that data looks correct

## Expected User Flow:

1. **User registers** → Profile automatically created
2. **Redirected to onboarding** → Guided profile setup
3. **Profile completion** → Success screen
4. **Template browsing** → Personalized recommendations
5. **Profile management** → Can edit anytime at `/profile`

## Success Indicators:

✅ Registration creates profile record in PocketBase  
✅ Onboarding flow works smoothly  
✅ Profile data saves correctly  
✅ Recommendations generate based on profile  
✅ Profile editing works without errors  
✅ No console errors in production  

## Troubleshooting:

### If profiles don't save:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check PocketBase logs

### If recommendations don't work:
- Verify profile data is complete
- Check that enhanced templates are loaded
- Test with `/test/profile-recommendations`

### If onboarding doesn't redirect:
- Check registration flow
- Verify environment variable is set
- Check for JavaScript errors
