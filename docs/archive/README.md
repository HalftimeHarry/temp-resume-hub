## Current Documentation

The current, consolidated documentation is in the main `docs/` folder:

- **[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Complete development guide
- **[docs/BACKEND.md](../BACKEND.md)** - Backend and database documentation  
- **[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Production deployment guide

## Why Archived?

These files were consolidated because:
- **Redundancy**: Multiple files covered similar topics
- **Outdated**: Some information was no longer current
- **Fragmentation**: Information was scattered across too many files
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain fewer, comprehensive docs

The important information from these files has been incorporated into the main documentation.
